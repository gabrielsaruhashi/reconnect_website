# Project Reconnect

ReConnect (Refugeeâ€¢Connect) aims to bridge a critical knowledge gap between refugees and their host communities by providing an app-based two- way learning platform that connects a local with a newcomer prior to their arrival in the country of relocation.

ReConnect addresses the lack of pre-departure education and information of the two communities whilst also enabling refugees to create and develop genuine networks within countries of relocation. The ReConnect application helps reduce social stigmas and negative stereotypes associated with refugees and promote better understanding of global forced migration challenges.
